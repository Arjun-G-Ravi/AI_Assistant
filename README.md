# AI_Assistant
 This repository contains a rule-based AI assistant named Jarvis, which I made in 2019.
 Since the technology has advanced quite a bit, **this project doesn't seem very useful for any purpose**, except for beginners who could try to make this their "first big project".
 This project also contains some bugs, which I didn't correct as the whole project is vastly superseded by even small LLMs such as GPT2.
